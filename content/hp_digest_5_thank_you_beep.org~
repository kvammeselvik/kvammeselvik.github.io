Dette er ein tjuvkopi av ei novelle frå det amerikanske tidsskriftet (?) "HP Digest", 1979. Forfattar er Gordon Dickson.

In this story, written especially for the Digest, science-fiction writer Gordon Dickson takes us to the mid-21st century where we discover the amazing HP-XX2050, a handheld calculator with surprising capabilities.
